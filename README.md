## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

I used mostly stackOverflow and w3schools. I also used random Google sites to look things up.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

I spent majority of my time getting buttons work correctly. Adding functionality user limited amount of time was also challenging.
Fortunately, I was able to overcome the challenge by reading the documentation of MDN and doing some research on Google.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

I don't have a specific question about web development in my mine, but I was amazed and I'm curios more about how the computer machine was able to generate different sounds and tones based off the frequency map numbers that is given to them.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I hade some extra time as I currently only have 24 hours left(with other responsibilities) for this project to be done, I would make the app look good by adding more CSS styling. I would also add some more functionality to the app by adding additional features. For example, I would add game difficulty where there will be beginner, medium, and hard levels by making computer go fast playback speeds up on each turn.
